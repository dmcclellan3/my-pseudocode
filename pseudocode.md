# Smoking BBQ (Boston Butt)




### Make sure that you have the following:

Smoker 

The fuel needed for the smoker that you own (wood pellets, charcoal or wood splits/chunks (hickory, oak or pecan))

Pork butt  

Your favorite BBQ rub   

Your BBQ sauce of choice  

Disposable aluminum pans (2)

Apple juice 

Mustard

Spray bottle

### Start

Heat your smoker to 275 degrees

While your smoker is getting up to temperature, remove your pork butt from any packaging and place on a pan.  

Cover all sides of the pork with a coating of mustard (this will help the seasoning adhere to the meat)

Add your BBQ rub to all sides of the pork and apply generously

Let the pork sit for 10 minutes to allow seasoning to adhere

While you are waiting, go to the smoker and check the temperature

If temperature has reached 275 your ready to start the cook 

Else allow 10 to 15 more minutes to reach 275

When temperature has been met place the meat on the grate on the opposite side of the heat source. 

Allow the the pork to smoke until it has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees.

After three hours of cooking add apple juice to your spray bottle 

Open your smoker and spray the surface of the meat on all sides until coated (to prevent burning)  Close the smoker and allow to continue cooking.

After another hour of cooking go back to the smoker to check

If the pork looks dry use your spray bottle again 

Else close the smoker and continue to cook

Repeat until you've reached your internal temperature target.
