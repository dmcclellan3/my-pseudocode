# Smoking BBQ (Boston Butt)




### Make sure that you have the following:

Smoker 

The fuel needed for the smoker that you own (wood pellets, charcoal or wood splits (hickory, oak or pecan))

Pork butt  

Your favorite BBQ rub   

Your BBQ sauce of choice  

Disposable aluminum pans (2)

Apple juice 

Mustard

Spray bottle

### Start

Heat your smoker to 275 degrees

While your smoker is getting up to temperature, remove your pork butt from any packaging and place on a pan.  

Cover the entire surface of the pork with a coating of mustard (this will help the seasoning adhere to the meat)

Add your BBQ rub to all sides of the pork and apply generously
